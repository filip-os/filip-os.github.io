                    The SCEC2020 Archive of our poster is now available. The poster
                    includes our study of the correlation of the observations with
                    basement depth and Vs30, as well as a comparison of the data with 3D
                    finite difference simulations predictions.

                <p>Abstract:</p>
                <p>
                    We study ground motion response in urban Los Angeles during the two
                    largest events (M7.1 & M6.4) of the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake
                    sequence, using recordings from multiple regional seismic networks as
                    well as a subset of stations from the much denser Community Seismic
                    Network (CSN - csn.caltech.edu), which is a dense 700-station,
                    strong-motion network permanently installed in the area of urban Los
                    Angeles. The response spectral (pseudo) accelerations (SA) for a
                    selection of periods of engineering significance are calculated.
                    Significant SA amplification is present and reproducible between the
                    two events. In general, the SA is coherent across the basin at periods
                    greater than 4 seconds, shows significant amplification in the
                    sedimentary basin, but the largest amplifications are not near the
                    deepest part of the basin. At shorter periods the motions are stronger
                    and less spatially coherent, indicating a high-level of scattering at
                    the kilometer scale length. We examine possible correlations of the
                    computed SA with two common geotechnical parameters: basement depth
                    and Vs30, and find no significant correlation for the 1-s period,
                    while a correlation appears and gets stronger for longer periods. In
                    the second part of the study, we examine the performance of 3D finite
                    difference simulations in estimating the ground motions and SA for the
                    largest event of the Ridgecrest earthquake sequence, using the two
                    different Southern California Earthquake Center 3D Community Velocity
                    Models: CVM-S and CVM-H. Overall, the simulations match the mean
                    amplitude and variance of the observations reasonably well. However,
                    they are not able to reproduce the exact locations of the maximum SAs.
