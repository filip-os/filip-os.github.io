                <p>Abstract:</p>
                <p>
                    There is an unprecedented increase in the number of real-time
                    measurements produced by permanent, dense accelerometer arrays in
                    buildings, an example being the Community Seismic Network. In the
                    present work, damage identification techniques are developed by
                    coupling such datasets with linear and nonlinear finite-element models
                    of buildings. Damage in steel-frame buildings is manifested in
                    localized areas as cracks in beam-column connections or as an average
                    stiffness reduction. High-fidelity linear or nonlinear finite-element
                    models are developed to allow for realistic behavior, including
                    modeling nonlinearities associated with the opening and closing of
                    cracks. L1 regularization techniques and sparse Bayesian learning
                    tools are further developed fully in the time domain to reduce
                    ill-conditioning and account for the sparsity of damage. The
                    effectiveness of the proposed methods in identifying the location and
                    severity of damage is demonstrated using simulated acceleration data
                    from a three-story steel frame building, and a 15-story building in
                    downtown Los Angeles that is fully instrumented.
