                    <b>Structural Damage Identification in Steel Buildings.</b>
                    My research goal is to identify the existence, location and severity
                    of damage, after the occurrence of a potentially destructive
                    earthquake event. This is achieved by combining the information
                    provided from dense sensor array measurements, such as the Community
                    Seismic Network (<a href="http://csn.caltech.edu/">CSN</a>), with the
                    information built into high-fidelity finite element models. Various
                    approaches are developed, implemented and tested, yielding promising
                    results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My most recent work is related to extending the sparse Bayesian
                    learning methodology for using input-output measured acceleration time
                    histories. Extension of the methodology for time histories allows the
                    use of nonlinear finite element models. The method is found to be
                    effective for identifying structural damage. Future goals include
                    applications on full scale or shake-table structures and data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project addresses an urgent need of characterizing the state of
                    structural health in buildings immediately after an earthquake event
                    so that corrective retrofit and repair actions can be made to maintain
                    desired levels of structural safety and reliability. Although this
                    project concentrates on high-rise steel-frame buildings, the framework
                    itself is applicable to other infrastructure systems such as bridges,
                    offshore structures, wind turbines etc, monitored by similar sensor
                    networks. The framework can also be used for damage identification in
                    related engineering disciplines such as mechanical and aerospace
                    engineering.

                    visualization following recent events recorded the network in the Los
                    Angeles area. Our most recently published study is concerned with data
                    recorded from the July 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence. The
                    collected data is used in order to study the ground-motion response in
                    urban Los Angeles, as well as for evaluating the predictive
                    capabilities of 3D finite difference simulations and ground motion
                    prediction equations. The study further promotes the importance of
                    dense accelerometer arrays in understanding local site behavior.

                    <b>Aerosol Transfer and Deposition on the Respiratory System.</b>
                    My diploma thesis (University of Thessaly - UTH) was in the area of
                    modelling aerosol transport and deposition in the respiratory system.
                    A dynamic, single-path model was developed for dry powder transport in
                    the lungs accounting for select particle and patient specific
                    parameters. The assumption of perfect alveolar mixing was explored.
                    Comparison with experimental data was satisfactory and indicative of a
                    perfect mixing mechanism being indeed present in the alveoli. Model
                    updating-parameter estimation and a sensitivity analysis was performed
                    in order to calibrate the model.
